        <title>An Ode to Dominic Calvert-Lewin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dominic Nathaniel Calvert-Lewin (born 16 March 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Everton and the England national team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calvert-Lewin began his career at local team Sheffield United, making his senior debut on loan at Conference North team Stalybridge Celtic in December 2014. He spent the first half of the 2015–16 season on loan at Northampton Town in League Two, and in August 2016 he joined Everton for a fee of £1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
