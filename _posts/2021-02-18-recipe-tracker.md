As someone who enjoys cooking and does it every day, I'm always on the lookout for new recipes or foods to try.
Documenting this passion for food is something I've wanted to do for a long time but never knew what format would be best for it,.
I have no expertise in food blogging or food photography and have no interest in sharing my amateur photos on Social Media.


However, I think a single, continuously updated blog post that is dedicated to documenting some interesting food
experiments and experiences is something I'd like to maintain.
It will give me something regular to update this site with and also be a great reference for my future self to keep track of
recipes I'd otherwise forget about or lose track of.

Here is a catalogue of interesting food bits I've tried in 2021:

1. [Focaccia From Scratch](#focaccia-from-scratch)
2. [Lobster with Prawn Toast](#lobster-with-prawn-toast)
3. [Vegan Hot Chicken Roll](#vegan-hot-chicken-roll)

### Focaccia From Scratch

I made this based on a recommendation from a friend and having seen the Claire Saffitz video on how to make one, and it turned out pretty well.
I used the BBC Good Food base recipe and experimented with the toppings based on Claire's video, adding some Red Harissa Pesto on one side of the loaf.
It was really easy to make and turned out well, highly recommend giving it a go!

### Lobster with Prawn Toast

I made these two recipes as a Valentine's day dine-in treat as all restaurants were closed.

It was my second time ever cooking lobster but it was a lot easier than I thought it would be! I had to watch a few videos on Youtube
to ensure I didn't mess up the lobster tails but it worked out in the end. I used 3 times as much garlic and butter than in the recipe,
which is quite conservative with its measurements. I served it with goose fat potatoes and some veg, and the excess melted garlic butter
made for a delicious sauce.

The prawn toast I remembered from an old Tesco pre-made Chinese finger food range, but came across a recipe for it and thought I'd try it.
It was super simple to cook and really decadent, and made for a great little starter. Definitely going to make it for a special occasion in the future.

### Vegan Hot Chicken Roll

As a proud Irish citizen, there are few things that bring me more comfort than a fresh,
crunchy deli Hot Chicken Roll (or Chicken Fillet Roll depending where you're from).

At the same time, I have recently been trying to eat fewer animal products while being able to enjoy a bit of indulgence now and then.
So when I came across **Plant Kitchen no-chicken southern fried tenders** in Marks and Spencers I knew I had to stick it in a bread roll.
There isn't much of a recipe here but I this was really tasty and had all the flavour of a standard Hot Chicken Roll so I thought I'd share!

The taste was really similar to what you'd get in a deli HCR, although the texture wasn't quite there.
Either way it was great to have a tasty plant-based twist on a classic.
